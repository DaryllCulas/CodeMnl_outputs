    <h1><a href="index.html">HOMING BREED</a></h1>
      <h2>Flying or Homing Breeds</h2>
        <b><p>Possibly the most famous, this category includes racing pigeons that are used for endurance flying (distance or height) and their homing instinct. 
          Breeds include Racing Homers and Rollers.</p></b>
        <b><p>Kolodziej says that Portuguese tumblers are one of the smallest breeds of pigeons. <i>“They are extremely fast flyers and they perform well.”</i></p></b>
        <b><p>Their small size is intriguing as well as the way they carry themselves. 
          They have an erect stance, powerful chest, and a small beak which makes their appearance pleasing.</p></b>
          <br>
          <p><i>“When the males court, they walk on tip-toe and almost inhale to make themselves appear more impressive,” Kolodziej has noticed. “Another interesting factor is the wide variety of colors and unique patterns. It is always exciting to watch the young birds feather out to see what you produced.
             My biggest enjoyment is watching them fly. I sit for hours and just watch.”</i></p>
