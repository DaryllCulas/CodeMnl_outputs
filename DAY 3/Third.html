    <h1><a href="index.html">HOMING BREED</a></h1>
      <h2>Flying or Homing Breeds</h2>
        <b><p>Possibly the most famous, this category includes racing pigeons that are used for endurance flying (distance or height) and their homing instinct. 
          Breeds include Racing Homers and Rollers.</p></b>
        <b><p>Kolodziej says that Portuguese tumblers are one of the smallest breeds of pigeons. <i>“They are extremely fast flyers and they perform well.”</i></p></b>
        <b><p>Their small size is intriguing as well as the way they carry themselves. 
          They have an erect stance, powerful chest, and a small beak which makes their appearance pleasing.</p></b>
