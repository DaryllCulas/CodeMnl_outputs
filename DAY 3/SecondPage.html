    <h1><a href="./index.html">FANCY BREEDS</a></h1>
      <h3>These pigeons are kept for their gorgeous color, form, and texture. I remember fondly going to the New York State fair, annually and visiting the poultry building. I would spend hours on the second floor which was dedicated to the whimsical types of pigeons New York fanciers had to offer. 
        These exhibition breeds included Fantails, Jacobins, Owls, Pouters, Tumblers, and Modenas.</h3>
      <h1>What do pigeons eat?</h1>
        <h3>Knowing what to <i><a href="https://backyardpoultry.iamcountryside.com/poultry-101/good-pigeon-loft-design/">feed pigeons</a></i> depends on the breed.
           Some types of pigeons, because of their beak and head size, may require only the smallest of seed and grain.</h3>

                     This khaki pied individual is an amazing example of artificial selection. </p>
