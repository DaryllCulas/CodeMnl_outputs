          <p><i>Recognized as a Master Breeder of Old Dutch Capuchines and Bavarian Pouters, Layne Gardner has had the good fortune of traveling the world photographing various types of pigeons. 
            In her 50 years of raising pigeons (she started early!), she has developed a passion for quality and enjoys seeing excellent specimens in various breeds.
             She may have chosen Capuchines for their elegant Cruella de Vil neck feathers and possibly the Bavarian Pouters for their attractive balloon-like crop. 
            But what characteristics and breed will you choose?</i></p>
